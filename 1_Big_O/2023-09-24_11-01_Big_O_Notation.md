Big O is a comparision metric for programs


Suppose we want to write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 up to and including the give number n 

<h1>soln 1:</h1>

function addUpTo(n){
    let total=0;
    for (let i=0;i<=n>;i++){
        total+=1;
    }
    return total;
}


Solution 2:

function addUpTo2(n) {
    return n*(n + 1) / 2;
}
